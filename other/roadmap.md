# Project Roadmap

This is where we‘ll define a few things about the library‘s goals.

Care to help? See [`contributing.md`](../contributing.md)

## Want to do

- [x] Auto-create the root directory for the generated project (no need to `mkdir` and `cd` before running `yo`)
- [x] Make [GitHub templates](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) (Issue & PR templates, Contributing guidelines) optional
- [x] Make extra docs ([Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org), Roadmap and Examples) optional

## Might do

## Won‘t do

- [ ] Integrate module bundler ([webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup), etc.) because it'll add complexities to this generator and it's also not everyone's need
